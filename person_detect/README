=============
Introduction
=============

This directory contains object detection benchmarking programs that test various object detection algorithms. For more information, read the README in each subdirectory.

The four object detection algorithms tested are:
	1. Haar Cascade Detection
	2. HOG Cascade Detection
	3. YOLO (You Only Look Once)
	4. Faster R-CNN

Our dataset is a subset of the INRIA Person Dataset. We use only images from the "positive training" subdirectory of the dataset.


=============
Installation
=============

To download dataset:
	$ sh download_dataset.sh

Each of the object detection algorithms must be installed individually (otherwise, installation would be prohibitively slow). Instructions can be found in each subdirectory's README.


======
Usage
======

Each benchmark program has the same usage:

	./benchmark [-h] [--data DATA] [--max_samples M_S]

		-h, --help			Show this help message and exit
		--data DATA			Location of dataset folder. Default: ..
		--max_samples M_S	Maximum number of dataset samples to test. Default: 614
